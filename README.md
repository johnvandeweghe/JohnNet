A Publish Subscribe (PubSub) service written using PHP's pthreads

This was mostly an attempt to play with pthreads using PHP. This setup was definitely not the right tool for the job, so I've stopped working on this project. It taught me a ton about concurrency, but it's far to unstable (mostly due to difficulty in development) to use in any real service.
